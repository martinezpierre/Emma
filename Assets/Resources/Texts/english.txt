Which dog time!
<2>
If there's one thing I will not regret, it's that damn weather!
<3>
But when I thought about it, I tell myself that there are not many things that will miss me in truth.
<4>
Probably my two, three friends at first.
<5>
And yet, it's been a while that we do not see much anymore.

[2]
<1>
My cat, he will surely be happier with someone else ...
<2>
I thought that would be more difficult from.
<3>
What is certain is that I break!
<4>
No more rain, bus delays, phone harassing you all day!

[3]
<1>
I leave this hole to join my little Emma! Finally !
<2>
I should be back already ...
<3>
I thought I'd get an hour or two, but it's been over three hours since I left the center without permission.
<4>
I forced the hand of Abigaelle for it covers me in case of problems, but I must go quickly, otherwise it will end up killing me.
<5>
Officially, "Aby" is my companion of record.
<6>
It was she who organizes my life: the composition of my meal until my hours of rest.
<7>
Unofficially, its role is to monitor me, to make sure that I am the instructions and I do not "slips" in his words!
<8>
If she could, she surely would control my dreams, to ensure they are compliant with the protocols, standards of safety and other regulations which no one has ever heard of, except her.
<9>
Here's a good question, haha, as if she did not know!

[4]
<1>
My watch is full of sensors. There are surely in my shoes, my shirt ...
<2>
Not to mention all the products they have had to inject me in recent months.
<3>
I prefer not to think about it!
<4>
Aby knows where I am.
<5>
I guess it was his polite way of saying that my leave is over and I have to go.
<6>
This monitoring has always imposed the implementation uncomfortable.
<7>
Aby will miss it.

[5]
<1>
It is with her that I spent most of my time these past two years, even though our relationship has always been very professional.
<2>
Excuse me, do you know when the next bus pass?
<3>
Hmm ... I would say in three days. Later.
<4>
How it in three days?
<5>
Haha! Thou shalt not be around!
<6>
Not really...
<7>
Two kilometers away is the bridge Dickinson. And during heavy rains tonight as the authorities deny access for security reasons.
<8>
So no bus as it rains I understand ...
<9>
Hey no!
<10>
This is the moment!

[6]
<1>
He's right, I do not know the area well.
<2>
For two years I got here, but I never really had the time to visit.
<3>
Between the planning of training sessions and meetings with the rest of the team, I find hardly any time to rest.
<4>
My contacts with the outside world have become almost non-existent and I hardly adventure to me beyond the limits of the Centre ...
<5>
It does not look to be in great shape?
<6>
I should be at work ... I thought slip away quietly for an hour time to clear my mind a little.
<7>
At work ? At this time ? But It's dark!
<8>
Yes, much of my work happens at night.
<9>
You're in what branch? Restoration? Valet Parking?
<10>
No, scientific. I work at the research center, and tonight I had an important meeting with the rest of the team ...
